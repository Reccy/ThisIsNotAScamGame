# This is NOT a Scam!

Welcome to the MacroFirmâ„¢ Technical Support Center!

You play as a technical support representative. Or more accurately: the best damn scam artist this company has ever seen! Ruin people lives, steal their credit card information, and get rich while doing so!

This is a game of persuasion. Gain your client's trust and convince them to give you their credit card information because it's in their best interests - or ruthlessly threaten them with the fact that you can ruin their lives!

This game was originally made for Ludum Dare 33. Version 2 available now!
